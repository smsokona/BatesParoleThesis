FINDINGS ARE BASED ON COMPREHENSIVE SURVEYS OF MORE THAN 8,000 STATE AND
LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTSCE EXECUTIVES, ANALYSIS OF A 1975 CENSUS SURVEY OF
50,000 EMPLOYEES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES, AND 250 FIELD VISITS. NEARLY
1 MILLION PERSONS WERE EMPLOYED IN STATE AND LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AGENCIES IN 1974, THE BASE YEAR OF THE ASSESSMENT. A BREAKDOWN OF THIS
FIGURE SHOWED THAT MORE THAN 580,000 WERE EMPLOYED BY POLICE PROTECTION
AGENCIES (80 PERCENT SWORN OFFICERS); MORE THAN 190,000 WERE EMPLOYED BY
COURTS, PROSECUTION AND LEGAL SERVICES, AND INDIGENT DEFENSE AGENCIES; AND
NEARLY 220,000 WERE INVOLVED IN CORRECTIONS. THE LARGEST PERSONNEL
SHORTAGES WERE REPORTED BY PROBATION AND PAROLE ADMINISTRATORS AND BY
SHERIFFS; JUVENILE CORRECTION AGENCIES REPORTED THE SMALLEST SHORTAGES.
SMALLER DEPARTMENTS REPORTED GREATER RELATIVE SHORTAGES THAN LARGER
DEPARTMENTS. THE COMPOSITE SURVEY FOUND A NEED FOR SELECTIVE INCREASES OF
PERSONNEL IN MOST CRIMINAL JUSTICE CATEGORIES, BUT ALSO FOUND THAT SUCH
INCREASES DO NOT REDUCE CRIME OR IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF JUSTICE UNLESS
COMBINED WITH IMPROVED PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR
IMPROVING DEPLOYMENT OF EXISTING PERSONNEL AND INCREASING PERSONNEL
EFFECTIVENESS. OVERALL, EMPLOYMENT IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES IS EXPECTED
TO GROW MORE SLOWLY BETWEEN 1975 AND 1985 THAN IN THE EARLY 1970'S, THE
COMBINED RESULT OF A PROJECTED SLOWDOWN IN CRIME RATES AS WELL AS TIGHTER
STATE AND LOCAL BUDGETS. THESE TRENDS ARE ANALYZED IN DETAIL IN THIS AND
THE OTHER VOLUMES IN THE SERIES. FOR RELATED VOLUMES IN THIS SERIES, SEE

THIS SECOND VOLUME IN A EIGHT-VOLUME SURVEY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE MANPOWER
NEEDS REPORTS THAT EMPLOYMENT IN STATE AND LOCAL POLICE PROTECTION AGENCIES
GREW FROM ABOUT 340,000 IN 1960 TO NEARLY 600,000 IN 1974, AN INCREASE OF
49 PERCENT IN PER CAPITA POLICE EMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER, CRIME RATES GREW BY
157 PERCENT. AS A RESULT, DEPARTMENTS WITH 1,000 OR MORE EMPLOYEES AND THE
SMALLEST AGENCIES ALIKE REPORT PERSONNEL SHORTAGES. GROWTH IN POLICE
EMPLOYMENT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ONLY 33 PERCENT BETWEEN 1975 AND 1985,
AS A RESULT OF A SLOWDOWN IN THE GROWTH OF CRIME RATES, A PROJECTED
REDUCTION IN STATE AND LOCAL BUDGET GROWTH, AND INCREASED ALLOCATION OF
AVAILABLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE FUNDS TO CORRECTIONS AND COURT AGENCIES.
CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT WILL INCREASE MORE RAPIDLY THAN EMPLOYMENT OF SWORN
OFFICERS, AND STATE AND COUNTY AGENCIES WILL INCREASE MORE RAPIDLY THAN
LOCAL DEPARTMENTS. RECRUITMENT OF WOMEN AND MINORITY PERSONS AND THEIR
EMPLOYMENT IN NONROUTINE JOBS CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM. AT PRESENT, 13
PERCENT OF RECRUITS BELONG TO MINORITY GROUPS, A FIGURE WHICH SHOULD BE 18
PERCENT TO COMPARE WITH THEIR REPRESENTATION IN THE GENERAL POPULATION.
WOMEN COMPRISE ABOUT 3 PERCENT OF ALL POLICE OFFICERS AND ARE CONCENTRATED
IN CLERICAL AND JUVENILE WORK. THIS REPORT RECOMMENDS MORE SPECIFIC
TRAINING FOR RECRUITS, GREATER TRAINING FOR LINE OFFICERS WHO BECOME
SUPERVISORS, AREAS OF NEEDED INSERVICE TRAINING, AND BETTER RECRUITMENT AND
PERSONNEL POLICIES. TABLES PRESENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING DATA COLLECTED
BY THIS SURVEY. A SUMMARY OF EFFECTS OF POLICE EXPENDITURES ON CRIME AND
CLEARANCE RATES IS INCLUDED IN APPENDED DATA. FOR RELATED VOLUMES IN THIS
SERIES, SEE NCJ-43739, V. 1 'SUMMARY REPORT'; NCJ-43740, V. 3
