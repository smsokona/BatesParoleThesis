Presents statistics on offenders supervised by adult correctional systems
in the United States at yearend 2013, including offenders supervised in the
community on probation or parole and those incarcerated in prison or local
jail. The report provides the size and change in the total correctional
population during 2013. It details the slowing rate of decline in the
population since 2010 and the downward trend in the correctional
supervision rate since 2007. It also examines the impact of changes in the
community supervision and incarcerated populations on the total
correctional population in recent years. Findings cover the size of the
male and female correctional populations and compare the rates of change in
the populations by correctional status since 2000. Appendix tables provide
information on other correctional populations, including prisoners under
military jurisdiction, inmates held by correctional authorities in the U.S.
territories and commonwealths, and jail inmates held in Indian country
facilities, and estimates of the total correctional population by
jurisdiction and correctional status. Findings are based on data from
several BJS correctional data collections.
